// This manifest.js file is required by the Rails asset pipeline (Sprockets)
// even for API-only applications when certain gems or test configurations
// expect it to exist.
//
// For this API-only application, we don't actually serve any assets,
// but this file prevents Sprockets errors during testing and development.
//
// The links above are standard Rails asset pipeline directives that would
// compile assets if we had any, but they're mainly here as placeholders.
